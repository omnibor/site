The OmniBOR Project has a new website, new documentation, and for the first
time, a project blog!

<!-- more -->

If you're reading this, then you can already see the new look of the OmniBOR
website. This new website does include a substantial redesign, intended to work
better on both desktop and mobile, but it also includes a substantial addition
of new content!

The project website now hosts the [OmniBOR specification][spec]. Our intent is
to keep this updated with any new release of the specification. If you'd like
to track the pre-release updates of new versions, we also link to the
[`omnibor/spec`][spec_repo] repository.

We've also added new [documentation][docs] intended to provide a more
accessible explanation of [Artifact IDs][artifact-ids],
[Input Manifests][input-manifests], and the other key concepts underlying what
we're doing with OmniBOR. If you're brand new to OmniBOR, we recommend you
start with this new documentation before diving into the more detailed
specification.

Finally, the new site has [a blog][blog]! This is the first post on that blog. In the
future we'll be using this to provide updates on the project, to share
information about work we're doing around the open source ecosystem, and more.

As always, OmniBOR is a project that benefits enormously from the
involvement of a broad community of people. If you're interested in solving
the challenge of universal software identity, we'd love for you to [get
involved][contribute]!
