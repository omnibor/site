OmniBOR is a project that values inclusivity toward contributors and toward
other projects. We want to empower _everyone_ using software to know what's in
their software, and we want to anyone to feel comfortable with helping to
make that dream a reality.

If I had to pick a single non-technical tagline for OmniBOR as a project, I'd
pick "OmniBOR is for everyone." When I say OmniBOR is for everyone, I really
mean it in every sense:

- __Inclusive__: we want anyone to feel comfortable contributing to OmniBOR no
  matter their ethnicity, race, gender, sex, native language, or anything else.
- __Collaborative__: we want to work with other communities to help their tools
  to produce OmniBOR manifests and identifiers, including getting our hands
  dirty with their code.
- __Reproducible__: we want anyone to be able to reproduce OmniBOR data; the
  design of the Artifact ID system ensures there's no central dictionary of
  names, or central list of registries that has to be maintained or referenced.
- __Complementary__: we want to complement other software identification
  schemes like CPE, pURL, Nix Store Paths, and more; and we want to complement
  SBOM standards like CycloneDX and SPDX.

This is a lofty set of goals, but one that I think gets to the heart of why I
personally contribute to the OmniBOR project, and why I believe we can achieve
the scale of our ambitions.

It's worth digging into each of these values in greater detail.

## OmniBOR is Inclusive

The OmniBOR project is an inclusive project. We _really_ mean that, both in
terms of the inclusiveness of the people who participate in the project today,
and in terms of the project rules we've established.

We maintain a Code of Conduct, currently the Contributor Covenant version 1.4.
